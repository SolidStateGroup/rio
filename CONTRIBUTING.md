# Pull Requests

The Solid State team will be monitoring for pull requests. When we get one, a member of team will test the work against our internal uses and sign off on the changes. From here, we'll either merge the pull request or provide feedback suggesting the next steps.

**A couple things to keep in mind:**

 - If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
 - Keep the code style (indents, wrapping) consistent.
 - If your PR involves a lot of commits, squash them using ```git rebase -i``` as this makes it easier for us to review.
 - Keep lines under 80 characters.
