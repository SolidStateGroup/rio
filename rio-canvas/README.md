# React Isomorphic
Intended for static sites and web applications that also need server-side rendering.
Around 57.5KB Compressed JS.

This automatically renders exactly the same React markup between client and server without config.

## Getting Started
**This will get you all setup and running ðŸš€**
```
git clone https://github.com/kyle-ssg/react-isomorphic.git && cd react-isomorphic && rm -rf .git && git init && npm install && npm start
```

### Run Dev - Run hot reloading node server
```
$ npm start
```

### Run Prod - Build, deploy, minify, cachebust and run production node server
```
$ npm run prod
```

### New Pages
Simply add a route to ```routes.js```. Wrap pages in ```DocumentTitle``` elements and a ```div``` child. 

*DocumentTitle elements allow you to manage the title of your page, it gets interpreted both on the server and client for seo purposes.*

If you wish the page to be completely static (Unlikely) you will need to add an entry to ```pages.js``` and add a corresponding handlebars template.

### Images/fonts etc
/fonts and /images always get deployed, if you wish to add more static folders you'll need to edit ```plugins.js```.

Static files are always served at the root, this means you just have to do ```<img src='/images/yourfile.png/>``` and ```background-image:url('/images/yourfile.png')```.


### Injecting initial data from the server

If your route requires the server to supply data to the initial render you can resolve the route as a promise in ```server-router.js```.
The flow for this is as follows
* 1 - ```server-router.js``` performs async calls necessary and resolves with params e.g. {data: 'Foo'}
* 2 - ```index.handlebars``` renders json to a tag with the id params
* 3 - Client components retrieve params by parsing the element's inner text (Use the helper in ```parse-params.js```)


- These should be cheap calls or only used if necessary as they block the server's response.
- A lot of the time it may be best to simply delay your api calls until componentDidMount.


### Dev Notes
- In dev mode the css is rendered in the body meaning you will see a flicker while it gets interpreted, this is for performance and doesn't happen in production.
- In dev mode you may get a warning about the server/client markup being out of sync, this error can be ignored as it is just a knockon affect from hot reloading.
